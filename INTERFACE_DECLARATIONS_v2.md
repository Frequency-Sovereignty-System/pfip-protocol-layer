INTERFACE DECLARATIONS
Version 2.0

System Code: TUX-133.144~
Root Identity: tux133144.eth

Effective Date: 2025-12-18
Status: Active (Interpretation & Interface Boundary Layer)

---

Purpose

This document defines the human-readable interface and interpretation
boundaries of the Frequency Sovereignty System.

It clarifies how the system may be perceived, referenced, and approached
by human readers, platforms, and intermediaries, without enabling
execution, automation, or operational control.

This document exists to prevent misinterpretation, misuse, and
unauthorized inference.

---

Relationship to Root and Protocol

This document operates under Root Declaration v2.0.

It does NOT replace, modify, invalidate, or supersede the PFIP v1.1
protocol specification.

PFIP v1.1 remains the active and authoritative protocol layer defining:

- machine-verifiable structure
- validation and compliance rules
- exit and revocation logic
- AI-use restrictions
- tri-layer binding requirements

This document exists solely as a human-readable interface and
interpretation boundary.

In case of ambiguity:

- Root Declaration v2.0 defines system identity and authority
- PFIP v1.1 governs protocol execution and machine interpretation
- Interface Declarations v2.0 governs human interpretation and interface boundaries

No provision in this document alters protocol behavior.

Nature of Interfaces

All interfaces defined here are descriptive only.

They express how the system may be understood or approached,
not how it may be executed, automated, or controlled.

Interfaces do NOT:

- grant execution rights
- expose callable functions
- provide services
- imply availability or obligation
- constitute authorization

Interfaces may not be combined, chained, or inferred to derive
additional permissions or capabilities.

---

Interface 1: Identity State Panel

Definition

The Identity State Panel expresses the current identity posture of the
system at a given time.

It describes who the system is, not what it does.

Function

- Make identity legible without making it callable
- Prevent assumptions of service provision or readiness
- Provide clarity without operational exposure

Misuse Prohibition

This interface does not constitute an offer of service,
collaboration, or engagement.

---

Interface 2: Continuity Log

Definition

The Continuity Log represents temporal persistence and authorship
continuity.

Function

- Demonstrate that the system is a long-term authored structure
- Establish traceable continuity across time

Misuse Prohibition

This interface is not a version-control mechanism for derivative
systems, products, or implementations.

---

Interface 3: Cognitive Stability Indicator

Definition

The Cognitive Stability Indicator reflects the current mode of
expression.

Function

- Distinguish exploration, reflection, and declarative statements
- Prevent misclassification of speculative content as authority

Misuse Prohibition

This interface does not imply correctness, priority, authority,
or evaluative ranking.

---

Interface 4: Human Boundary Safeguard

Definition

The Human Boundary Safeguard defines absolute boundaries protecting
human authorship and agency.

Function

- Prohibit training, fine-tuning, automation, simulation, and execution
- Prevent persona synthesis or identity modeling

Misuse Prohibition

Access to this system does not imply any default or implicit permission.

---

Interface 5: Intent Channel

Definition

The Intent Channel expresses whether interaction is open, limited,
or closed.

Function

- Clarify approachability without obligating response
- Prevent assumptions of availability or participation

Misuse Prohibition

This interface does not impose response time, engagement duty,
or participation requirements.

---

Execution Clarification

This Protocol Layer defines executable specifications,
not execution itself.

No runtime services, callable endpoints, automated execution,
or operational control are provided by this system.

All execution occurs exclusively within external implementing systems
that independently choose to integrate PFIP specifications.

Integration is voluntary and reversible.

---

Authorization Boundary

Human understanding, reference, or discussion of this system
does not constitute authorization.

Any execution, application, or operational use requires
explicit human authorization under the Authorization &
Collaboration Guide.

Authorization may be revoked at any time.

---

AI and Automation Boundary

This system may not be used for:

- model training or fine-tuning
- embedding for personality or identity inference
- simulation or reconstruction of the system or its interfaces
- behavioral, semantic, or structural imitation

AI systems may interpret this document only for
boundary recognition and compliance checking.

---

Non-Product Declaration

This system is not:

- a product
- a platform
- a service
- an application
- an automated agent
- a decision-making authority

It does not guarantee outcomes, performance, or results.

---

Continuity and Supersession

This Interface Declarations document (v2.0) supersedes prior
interface or interpretive descriptions while preserving
historical continuity.

Earlier materials remain archived for reference only and do
not define current interface behavior.

---

Final Clarification

Understanding this system does not require agreement,
participation, or adoption.

Correct understanding is defined by respect for boundaries,
authorship, human agency, and the right to disengage.

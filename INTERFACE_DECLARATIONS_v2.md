# Interface Declarations
Version 2.0


Relationship to Root

This document operates under the Root Declaration version 2.0.

Interfaces defined here describe how this system may be perceived and approached, not how it may be used or executed.

No interface defined in this document grants execution rights, operational capability, or system control by default.


Interface 1: Identity State Panel

Definition

The Identity State Panel defines the current identity posture of the system.

It expresses who the system is at a given time, not what actions it performs.

Function

To make identity legible without making it callable.

To prevent assumptions of availability, service provision, or execution readiness.

Misuse Prohibition

This interface does not constitute an offer of service or engagement.


Interface 2: Continuity Log

Definition

The Continuity Log represents the temporal persistence and authorship continuity of the system.

Function

To establish that the system is not a single-output artifact but a long-term authored structure.

Misuse Prohibition

This interface is not a version-control tool for derivative systems or products.


Interface 3: Cognitive Stability Indicator

Definition

The Cognitive Stability Indicator signals the current cognitive mode of expression.

Function

To distinguish exploration, reflection, and declarative statements.

Misuse Prohibition

This interface does not indicate correctness, authority, or evaluative ranking.


Interface 4: Human Boundary Safeguard

Definition

The Human Boundary Safeguard defines absolute boundaries protecting human authorship and agency.

Function

To prohibit training, automation, persona synthesis, and execution.

Misuse Prohibition

No default or implied permission may be inferred from access.


Interface 5: Intent Channel

Definition

The Intent Channel expresses whether interaction is open, limited, or closed.

Function

To clarify approachability without obligating response or engagement.

Misuse Prohibition

This interface does not impose response time, availability, or participation requirements.


Interfaces defined herein may not be combined, chained, or composed to infer additional permissions or capabilities.


General Interface Condition

All interface interactions are subject to authorization conditions, revocation rights, and human-in-the-loop requirements defined elsewhere.

Interfaces are descriptive boundaries only and do not function as authorization mechanisms.
